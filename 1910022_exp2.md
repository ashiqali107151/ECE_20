## Experiment No: 02
## Name of Experiment: Best Coding Practices.

## 1. camelCase:

- In camelCase, the first word is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.
- It is commonly used for variable names and function names in JavaScript and many other programming languages.

### Use Cases:

- **JavaScript:** Variables, function names
- **Java:** Variables, method names
- **C++:** Variables, function names

### Examples:

### Function names in js

```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

## 2. PascalCase:

- In PascalCase, the first letter of each word is capitalized.
- It is commonly used for class names and constructor function

### Use Cases:

- **Java:** Class names
- **C#:** Class names, namespaces, properties, method names
- **JavaScript (React.js):** Component names
- **Python:** Class names

### Examples:
### component name in React.js
```javascript
class UserProfile {
  constructor(id, name) {
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

## 3. kebab-case:

- In kebab-case, all letters are lowercase, and words are separated by hyphens.
- It is commonly used for file and folder names, especially in web development for CSS classes and HTML IDs.

### Use Cases:

- **HTML/CSS:** Class names, IDs, file names
- **URLs:** Used in web addresses for better readability
- **JavaScript/Front-End Frameworks:** Vue.js and Angular often use kebab-case for component or directive names

### Examples:

#### class name in HTML

```html
<div class="profile-card">
  <img src="picture.jpg" />
</div>
```

## 4. snake_case:

- In snake_case, all letters are lowercase, and words are separated by underscores.
- It is commonly used in Python for variable names and function names.

### Use Cases:

- **Python**: Variables, function names, file names
- **C**: Variables, function names
- **SQL**: Column names, table names

### Examples:

#### variable & function name in python

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
    return a + b
```

## Experiment No: 03
## Name of Experiment: Study of different git commands..

## 1. Introduction:
Git is a distributed version control system that lets multiple users collaborate on a project efficiently. It maintains a history of changes, supports branching, and ensures seamless teamwork.

---

## 2. Fundamental Git Operations
### Initializing a New Repository
- **Purpose:** To start tracking your project's files with Git.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
### Cloning an Existing Repository
- **Purpose:** To copy an existing project from a remote server.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
  ```
### Checking the Status of the Repository
- **Purpose:** To display the state of your working directory.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git status
  ```
### Adding Files to Staging Area
- **Purpose:** To prepare files for a commit.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git add filename
  git add .
  ```
### Committing Changes
- **Purpose:** To save staged changes in the local repository.
- **Command:**
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add descriptive message here"
  ```

## 3. Branching and Merging
### Creating and Switching:
- create branch
```bash
git branch new-feature
```
- Switch to a Branch
```bash
git checkout new-feature
```
### Merging:
```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

## 4. Collaboration with Git:
### Remote Repo management:
- add a remote repo:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```
- View Remote Repositories:
```bash
git remote -v
```
- Fetch Changes without Merging:
```bash
git fetch origin
```
- Pull and Merge Changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

## 6. Conclusion:
This lab covered essential Git commands, highlighting their practical applications for managing code repositories. Mastering these commands is crucial for efficient project collaboration and version control.
